# Un/Popular Worldwide Fishing Exploratory Data Analysis

This project serves as a data analysis to analyze fishing popularity from 1950 to 2018. I decided to do this project relating to fishing since my friend has taken me to Oceanside, CA to fish at the pier there. Previously, I used to think that fishing was boring and uninteresting since you would wait for most of the time before you get a bite. However, with an open mind of trying new activities and some free time, I took the opportunity to go with my friend to fish. Luckily, my friend is an experienced veteran who has been fishing since he was a kid so he showed me all the ropes. After catching my first few catches of smelt and mackerel, I was on a ***fishing thrill***. It felt amazing. I could absolutely see why folks who go out to fish are passionate about the sport. Ever since, I always make an effort to always go out fishing with my friend whenever he texts me to go out. To anyone reading this, go try it out. It truly feels great catching your first fish, even if it is a tiny one. This project serves to combine my skills in Python and data analysis (more so reviewing data analysis) and my new-found interest in fishing.

Here is the dataset I used for this exploratory data analysis:
- [Worldwide Fishing Catch Statitstics 1950-2018](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thebumpkin/worldwide-fishing-catch-statitstics-1950-2018)

This project serves to answer the questions:
- **For each country, what oceanic species are consistently ranked among the top (e.g., top 5) most fished over multiple years?**
- **For each country, what oceanic species are consistently ranked among the least fished (non-zero total) over multiple years?**

The purpose of these questions could be used to identify over-fishing or potential species that could be used to replace overfished species. My first hypothesis was that the consistently ranked species on the top would be some form of carp species. My second hypothesis was that the the consistetnly ranked species on the bottom would be a specific kind of species not generally largely produced. In my second hypothesis, I also expected to see species like the Antarctic Krill or the Pacific Sandlance towards towards the bottom.

The main purpose of this project was to gain a proficient understanding in:
- Data Cleaning in Python
  - Used numpy and pandas to clean dataframes
- Bivariate Data Analysis in Python *(Review)*
  - Used matplotlib and seaborn to plot the data into a visualization
 
I created a [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yNGJ8BpSxwyiF8MLzc3muRVefnnXqYudGKSu0k_ep_Y/edit?usp=sharing) that shares my experience everyday during the process of this project. This doc shows a raw experience of my processes and difficulties during the extent of this project. Each day, when worked on this project, was about an average of two hours. In retrospect, the progress went fairly slow for what the final product serves, but I plan to improve on this in the next project.

The resulting boxplots can be seen in the .ipynb file where the y-axis represents the species per box plot and the x-axis represents the count of species. The Discussion and Conclusion can also be seen in the .ipynb file as well.

This is another relatively simple project. However, I am very proud of myself. I am on the path towards a career that actually interests me. Very excited for what the future lies ahead.

As a statement for myself: *I am a strong individual and will overcome hurdles to build a good future for myself.*
